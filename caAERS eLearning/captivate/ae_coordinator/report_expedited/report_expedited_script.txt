[ introduction ]

caAERS is used to report adverse events that occur during clinical trials.  Once you have added the adverse events to the selected course or cycle, and caAERS determines the appropriate expedited reports to submit, you must supply additional information needed to complete the reports.  A five day expedited report is required when certain adverse event and protocol conditions are met.  caAERS looks at various fields, such as grade, hospitalization, and protocol phase.  In the previous session, you learned how to create and submit a 24 hour expedited report.  In this session, you will learn how to create and submit a 5 day expedited report.

[ dashboard ]

To begin, we need to see the list of reports that are still outstanding for our subject.  You can find this out through the Manage Reports workflow under the Adverse Events tab.  

Please click Manager Reports.

[ manage reports search ]

Let's search for our reports by entering the study and subject into the auto-completers.  I'll enter 8 2 3 1 into the study field, you select the Phase I study that appears.

I'll enter S C O T T into the subject field, and you select Michael Scott. 

Now click continue to bring us to the next screen.

[ manage reports ]

This page contains all of the completed and in-progress reports for the subject.  It is organized by course.  You can see the course in the first column, number of reports and adverse events in the next two colums, and the status in the second to last column.  This status is particularly important because it let's us know whether for that cycle there are any reports, they are due, or they are complete.  The last column let's us edit the adverse events for that cycle.  Please click the plus button next to cycle five.

Now we have a listing of each of the completed and in-progress reports for cycle 5.  You can see that the CTEP 24 hour notification is complete.  If you recall, we submitted this report in the previous lesson.  We also see that a CTEP expedited report is due in five days.  Please click the link for CTEP Expedited Report so that we can get started on it.

[ reporter ]

We have now entered a workflow that should be familiar to you.  It is has the same set of steps as the 24 hour notification.  caAERS has saved us time and effort by copying all of the data from the 24 hour notification into the five day expedited report.  However, we still need to validate that all of the data is still accurate, update any data that has changed, and enter any additional relavent information.

It appears that the reporter information is the same.  The reporter still has not changed, nor has the treating physician.  Therefore, please click save and continue to bring us to the next screen.

[ adverse events ]

Before reviewing the adverse events, note that you can jump to any specific task my clicking on it in the gray bar at the top.  For example, if there are specific data items that you would like to edit before reviewing each page, you can skip directly to them.  However, I will continue going through the workflow page-by-page.  Now, I will carefully review the adverse events to insure they are correct.

Everything looks correct, so please click save and continue.

[ describe event ]

-- text entry --
Events began resolving 48 hours after patient was removed from therapy.
-- end text entry --

As you know, describing the event is one of the most critical sections of the report.  Therefore, we should update the description based upon additional notes that we received from the physician.  I'll edit the description field to reflect that the events are resolving.  

Now, you change the present status from Not recovered/Not resolved to Recovering/Resolving.

Please click Save and Continue to navigate to the next screen.

[ course ]

The course looks correct.

Please click Save and Continue to navigate to the next screen.

[ study interventions ]

Let's review the study interventions.

There are no changes to the study interventions.  Please click Save and Continue.

[ subject details ]

Let's review the subject details.

Everything is correct, so please click Save and Continue.

[ other causes ]

If you recall, we skipped this task when entering the 24 hour notification.  Therefore, let's make sure to complete it for the expedited report.  This screen allows you to enter information regarding other circumstances that might have been related to the event or contributed to the event being reported.  Click add a cause.

Now, I will enter dehydration as a possible cause.

Finally, please click Save and Continue.

[ labs ]

We also skipped the labs task when entering the 24 hour notification.  This page allows you to enter any lab tests that are relevant to the adverse event.  There are two labs relavent for this case.  

Please click add a lab.

Select chemistry from the lab category drop-down list.

Since this list is pretty long, I will select sodium - blood from the test name.

You will see that this test requires some additional details.  I will enter them for you.

-- break --

Now, let's add the next lab.  Click add a lab.

Select chemistry as the lab category.

Now, select glutamic oxaloacetic transferase as the test name.

I will also enter these details for you.

-- break --

Now that we are finished, please click Save and Continue to bring us to the next screen.

[ attribution ]

As you know, the attribution screen allows you to attribute the level of relatedness to each potential cause.  You will notice that there is not a check mark next to the attribution task at in the top gray bar.  This is because we must attribute new other cause that we added: dehydration.  In addition, we must confirm that all of the other attributions are correct.

You can help me attribute the primary AE, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and I will do the rest.

Select unlikely for dehydration.

The rest of the attributions for Stevens-Johnson syndrome are correct, so I will go ahead and complete the attribution of dehydration.

-- break --

Now that all the attribution is complete, please click Save and Continue.

[ additional info ]

Since we have no additional information to include, please click Save and Continue.

[ review and submit ]

You will see that the five day expedited report requires sign-off by a physician.  The check box in the middle of the screen reminds us of this, as well as the information to be completed box below.  You can access the preview functionality by clicking the Actions button.  From here, you can export the draft report in a variety of formats.  Since a physician has reviewed and approved this report, please click the checkbox indicating this.  

Now the report is ready to be submitted. Click the submit action to continue.

[ submitter ]

We are now in the final workflow to submit the created report.  The first screen let's us enter different submitter details from the reporter. 

In this case, the submitter is different, so please uncheck that the submitter is the same as the report.

Now, I will enter the submitter details for you.

-- break --

Now that the submitter details are correct please click Save and Continue.

[ recipients ]

We do not have any additional recipients, so please click the Submit button to submit the report. 

[ submission status ]

The final screen shows us the status of our submitted report.  From here, we can also export the report to a variety of formats.  We can check back to this screen later to determine whether the report submitted to AdEERS  successfully.

[ submission status recheck ] 

It has been a couple minutes, and we have checked back to see if the status of our submission has changed.  And, it indeed has.  The information was saved successfully, and the submission went through without a problem.  We can click view server response to get further details for debugging purposes.

[ conclusion ]

That concludes the caAERS AE Coordinator creating and submitting a five day expedited report tutorial.  In this session, you learned how to create an expedited report from an already entered set of adverse events, as well as submitted that report.  In the upcoming lessons, you will learn how to edit and amend an adverse event report.
