[ introduction ]

caAERS is used to report adverse events that occur during clinical trials.  Once you have added the adverse events to the selected course or cycle, and caAERS determines the appropriate expedited reports to submit, you must supply additional information needed to complete the reports.  A 24 hour expedited report is required when certain adverse event and protocol conditions are met.  caAERS looks at various fields, such as grade, hospitalization, and protocol phase.  In the previous session, you learned how to enter adverse events, and caAERS determined that a 24 hour expedited report is required.  This session describes how to create and submit that report.

[ reporter ]

The 24 hour notification has a limited set of fields that are required compared to the full expedited report.  We will enter those fields that are required, though you can enter additional data if you prefer.  This data will be transferred to the full expedited report when you are ready to enter it.

The first step is to enter the contact information for the people reporting the adverse events.  These individuals can be selected from drop-down menus, which will fill in the details for you.  While the name of the Principal Investigator will automatically appear on the report, you must enter the reporter and treating physician.  I will enter these details for you.

Now, click Save and Continue to bring us to the next page.

[ adverse events ]

You will notice a check mark appeared next to the Reporter step in the grey task bar towards the top of the page.  Furthermore, you can also see yellow asterisks next to the steps that are required.  Finally, you will also see that there is a check mark next to Step 2: Adverse Events, which is the step that we currently are on and indicates that data entry is complete.  As I scroll down the page, you can see that these are the details that we already entered in the previous lesson.

It is important that we review each of the adverse event details to insure that they are correct.  Click on the plus symbol next to Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

We see that the details are correct.  I will help you review the rest of the adverse events.

Now, click Save and Continue to move to the next screen.

[ describe event ]

-- text entry --

Describing the event is one of the most critical sections of the report.  You must provide detailed information about the event including the presentation of the event, the treatment of the event, clinical findings, and the timing of the event in relation to study interventions. The goal is to be as complete as possible.  I will enter this into the description field.  

Now, mark the present status as not recovered/not resolved.

Next, select No for whether the subject has been retreated.

Finally, I will enter the date the subject was removed from the protocol.

Please click Save and Continue to navigate to the next screen.

[ course ]

If you recall from the previous lesson, we already entered the details of the Course.  However, we have an opportunity to review and make modifications.  Please click Save and Continue.

[ study interventions ]

On this next screen, we must enter the study agents.  The dose and unit of measurement are required, while the rest of the fields are optional.

Please select G D C - 0 4 4 9 from the study agent list.

I'll enter the dose of 3750.

You select mg for milligrams from the unit of measure list.

I'll enter the date last administered.  

Now, since a second investigational agent was administered, click Add.

I'll enter the details of O S I - 7 7 4 for you.

-- break --

Please click Save and Continue.

[ subject details ]

The Subject Details page contains several sections regarding the subject's relevant medical history.  It is necessary that you verify all information that already exists on this page and make any necessary changes or additions.

I will enter the height and weight as 174.5 centimeters and 79.3 kilograms.  Notice that the body surface area is automatically calculated for us.  

I verified that the disease information is correct: solid tumor, adenocarcinoma, with primary site in the colon.  

The metastatic sites of liver and lymph node are correct.  If you needed to add additional sites, you could use the add button, and sites can be removed with the red trash button.
 
The pre-existing conditions and concomitant medications are both correctly empty.  If needed, you can add these with the add buttons.

Now, we must review the prior therapies to see if the details are correct.

Since the prior therapies all looked correct, please click Save and Continue to bring us to the next screen.

[ other causes and labs ]

Other causes and labs are not required for the 24 hour notification.  Therefore, we will skip them.  Please click the Attribution task in the gray taskbar at the top.

[ attribution ]

The attribution screen allows you to attribute the level of relatedness to each potential cause.  This is different than the attribution that we provided in the adverse event details, and it is a critical step in the 24 hour notification. 

You can attribute the primary AE, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and I will do the rest.

Select unlikely for the solid tumor.

Select definite for G D C - 0 4 4 9.

Select definite for O S I - 7 7 4.

Select unlikely for dehydration.

-- break --

Now that all the attribution is complete, please click Save and Continue.

[ additional info ]

This screen allows you to select any additional information to include with the expedited report, such as an autopsy report or discharge summary.  Since we have no additional information to include, please click Save and Continue.

[ review and submit ]

The review and submit screen allows us to make any additional changes to the report, as well as preview the report.  You can access the preview functionality by clicking the Actions button.  Furthermore, caAERS will provide notifications of any missing data that is necessary to complete the report.  

In this case, data entry is complete, and the report is ready to be submitted. Click the submit action to continue.

[ submitter ]

We are now in the final workflow that let's us submit the  report that we just created.  The first screen let's us enter different submitter details from the reporter.  

In this case, the submitter is different, so please uncheck that the submitter is the same as the report.

Now, I will enter the submitter details for you.

-- break --

Now that the submitter details are correct please click Save and Continue.

[ recipients ]

This screen allows us to add additional recipients of the report.  You could enter emails in the Cc field.  However, we do not have any additional recipients, so please click the Submit button to submit the report. 

[ submission status ]

The final screen shows us the status of our submitted report.  From here, we can also export the report to a variety of formats.  We can check the status of the submission by clicking the Submission Status task at the top to refresh the screen.  Please click the Submission Status task.

[ submission complete ] 

The information was saved successfully, and the submission went through without a problem.  We can click view server response to get further details for debugging purposes.

[ conclusion ]

That concludes the caAERS AE Coordinator creating and submitting a 24 hour notification tutorial.  In this session, you learned how to create a 24 hour notification from an already entered set of adverse events, as well as submit that report.  In the upcoming lesson, you will learn how to create and submit a five day expedited report.
