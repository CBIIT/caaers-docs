[ introduction ]

This session will guide you through process of creating and entering a new adverse event.

[ initiate ]

Once logged into caAERS, there are multiple ways to initiate a new adverse event report. For starters, you can use the Report Adverse Events task under the Adverse Events tab.  

However, this guide will walk you through initiating a new adverse event report from the Dashboard page. You will see a number of useful actions under the Quick Links on the right-hand side of the page.  

To get started, I will need you to click on the Report Adverse Events link.

The first step is to select the study, subject, and course or cycle.  In the auto-completers below, you can enter any part of the study and subject name or identifier.

I will enter 8 2 3 1 into the study field, which is part of the study identifier, and you select the phase one study from the auto-completer drop-down menu.

I will then enter S C O T T into the subject field, and you select the subject with identifier 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 9.

In the course/cycle menu, all existing reporting periods are displayed.  This allows you to enter adverse events that are needed for those reporting periods.  In that case, you can  simply select the appropriate reporting period and Continue.  However, we will create a new reporting period, so please select Create New from the Course/Cycle menu.

In this window, you will need to enter the details of the new Course or Cycle with which the the adverse event is associated. All fields with a red asterisk are required, and the red shading of the field will disappear once you enter a valid value.  I will enter the start date of the course/cycle and the course/cycle number.  The correct treatment assignment of A4 is already selected for us.  

Now, you click the Save button in the bottom right-hand corner of the window.

caAERS indicates to us that the Course/Cycle was created successfully, so you click the Continue button to bring us to the next screen.

[ details ]

The next step is to enter the details of the Adverse Events.  Note the blue box at the top of the screen that contains the details that we entered in the previous screen.  This information will follow us through the workflow to remind us of the subject, study, and course on which we are working.  Now, I will add the Adverse Event Details with some help from you.  

-- enter 2 adverse events with the trainee, then add all the rest myself --  

Now that we are finished with this page, you  click Save and Report to bring us to the next screen.  

[ review ]

On this last page, we have an opportunity to review reporting recommendations.  As you can see, caAERS has notified us that an action is recommended.  It is important to carefully review these recommendations before taking action.  As I scroll down, we see that an expedited report is required.  You click on the Report button to continue.

[ conclusion ]

Now you would continue to the Reporter page and add all the information necessary to generate and submit the selected report.  However, that is a lesson for a separate tutorial.  In this session, you have learned how to successfully create an adverse event report.  In the next session, you will learn how to complete the steps necessary to submit an expedited adverse event report.
