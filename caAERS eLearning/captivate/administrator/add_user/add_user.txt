[ introduction ]

This session will guide you through the process of adding new personnel and users to caAERS.  In caAERS Personnel represent people involved in a clinical study, such as a clinical research assistant or a physician.  These personnel can also be users of caAERS, but this is not required.  You can have personnel that are not users as well as users that are not personnel. 

[ dashboard ]

Once logged into caAERS, the personnel workflow can be found under the Administration tab.  

Please click Personnel under the Administration tab.

[ personnel ]

From here, we can either search for personnel by a variety of criteria such as name, identifier, and organization, or we can create or edit personnel.  Please click the Create/Edit Personnel task.

[ basic details ]

This screen contains all of the fields necessary to create new personnel.

The first set of information needed are basic details, such as the personnel's name and email address.  I will fill these details in for you.

There are two additional options in this section: create as person and create as user.  A person is involved in the clinical study in some way and will be searchable through the appropriate fields throughout caAERS.  A user has access to caAERS and can perform the actions that they are privileged to perform based on their role.  In this case, let's create a personnel that is both a person and a user.  Since both of these boxes are already checked, we can continue.

[ person details ]

Now that we've selected our basic details, we need to add additional information.  If this personnel is a person, we need to enter the type of person, the person's identifier, and any organizations with which that person is to be associated within caAERS.  For type of person, select research staff.

I will enter the person's identifier, which will uniquely identify the person within caAERS.

Now, let's enter an organization for this person.  Please click the Add Organization button.

The organization field is an autocompleter.  I'll begin typing Duke, and you select Duke University Medical Center at the end of the list.  

Selecting the correct organizations for the person is important because it will help caAERS suggest the appropriate personnel in auto-completers throughout the application.

[ user details ]

The user details section allows us to enter a user name and select roles that give the user access to various actions within caAERS.

I'll enter the user name for you.

Explaining each of the roles that are available is outside the scope of this tutorial - please see the caAERS user guide for this.  

Let's create a user that can enter adverse events and create adverse event reports.  The AE Reporter role appears to be what we want.  Please click the plus button.

Under each role is a description of the privileges that the role bestows upon the user.  In this case, an AE reporter can create and update information about adverse events, submit reports, and enter required adverse events that need to be assessed.  Click the checkbox to grant this user the AE reporter role.

caAERS divides privileges in the system by organization and study.  In this way, you can allow users to perform actions for only a specific organizations and/or only specific studies.  This is critical for multi-site studies, especially when caAERS is being used by multiple different organizations.  However, there is also the option to grant a user the role across all sites and all studies.

In this case, it is appropriate to grant the user the AE Reporter role for all studies at Duke.  I'll enter Duke and you select Duke University Medical Center.

It is necessary to click Add Organization in order to apply the selected organization.  Please click Add Organization.

Now, select all study access.

[ Save ]

Once you save a user, she will be emailed instructions to create a password for her account.  

Please click the Save button to continue.

[ conclusion ]

In this session, you have learned how to successfully create personnel that is both a user and a person within caAERS.  In the next session, you will learn how to edit personnel.
