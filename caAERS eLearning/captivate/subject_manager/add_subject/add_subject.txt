[ introduction ]

This session will guide you through the process of adding new subject to caAERS.  In caAERS subjects are participants in clinical studies and can incur adverse events that can be added to caAERS and reported.  A subject can be assigned to more than one study.  Subject data entered into caAERS is reused as much as possible throughout all appropriate caAERS workflows. 

[ dashboard ]

Once logged into caAERS, the enter subject workflow can be accessed via the Subjects tab at the top of the screen or the Quick Links to the right.  

Please click Enter Subject under the Quick Links on the right-hand side of the window.

[ details ]

The first step in the enter subject workflow is to enter basic details, such as the site the subject belongs to, the subjects name, and identifiers assigned to the subject.

Let's first select the organization to which the subject belongs.  Please select Duke University Medical Center from the drop-down list.

Now we must enter the demographic information.  I'll enter the name, subject identifier, and date of birth for your.  

Select Male from the Gender menu.  

Select Not Hispanic or Latino from the Ethnicity menu.  

Select White from the Race menu.

Next, we have an opportunity to add additional identifiers for the subject.  For example, an organization may assign a medical record number, or a system may assign a unique identifier.  Let's add an organizational identifier.  Please click the add identifier button.

I'll enter the identifier for you.

Select Medical Record Number from the Identifier Type drop-down menu.

I'll enter Duke into the organization, and you select Duke University Medical Center from the drop-down list.

You can add any number of organization and system assigned identifiers, and you can use the X icon tok remove them.

Please click Continue to bring us to the next screen.

[ choose study ]

Please note that the subject name above the search criteria panel that follows us through the subsequent screens to remind us of the subject that we are currently creating.

The choose study screen optionally allows us to register a subject to a study.  If you do not wish to register the subject at this time, you can skip this step by clicking the Continue button.  However, let's register the subject to a study.  I'll enter GDC into the search field, and you click the search button.  

The results can be found under the search criteria panel.  Select the option selector next to the resulting study identifier.

All subjects registerd to a study in caAERS must have an identifier on that study.  I'll enter this for you.

Now, click continue to bring us to the next screen.

[ subject medical history ]

The Subject Medical History page is extremely important in caAERS because this information is reused throughout the adverse event entry and reporting workflows.  Entering it once here can safe time and reduce errors later on.

The first step is to enter the subject's baseline performance.  Please select Symptomatic, Fully Ambulatory from the drop-down menu.

Now we will enter the primary disease information.  Select Solid Tumor, NOS for not otherwise specified.

I will enter intracranial tumor into the other field.

Now I'll type B R A I N into the primary site field, and you select brainstem.

I'll enter the date of initial diagnosis.

Now, let's add colon to the metastatic disease sites.  Click the Add button.

After I type colon into the site name, you select colon.

Greg Mason has a pre-existing condition of hypertension.  Click the add button.

Select Hypertension from the drop-down menu.

Concomittant medications are non-protocol medications that may have contributed to the disease.  In this case, we have none.

The Prior Therapies field can include both therapies for the current study disease, as well as for other diseases if the therapies are relavent to reporting on for the study.  In this case, we do no have any prior therapy.

Please click continue to bring us to the next screen.

[ summary ]

The final screen in the workflow gives us an opportunity to review all of the information that we have entered thus far.  

Click the plus symbol next to medical history in order to review the medical history for the study to which we registered the subject.

Now that everything looks correct, please click Save to enter this subject and registration into the system.

[ conclusion ]

In this session, you have learned how to successfully enter and register a new subject.  In the next session, you will learn how to edit subject details.
