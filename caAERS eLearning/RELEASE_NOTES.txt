caAERS eLearning System @VERSION@

################
# INTRODUCTION #
################

The caAERS eLearning System is a web-based set of video tutorials.  The content of the system is driven by
JavaScript objects defined in web/js/content.js.  The lessons themselves are built using Adobe Captivate.
The source Captivate projects can be found in the captivate directory, and the flash swf files are found
in the web/lessons directory.  The System does not require any external resources or a web container to 
run.  Therefore, it can be run locally or remotely via web browser.  You can run the System directly from
source by opening web/index.html in your web browser.

For more information on running the caAERS eLearning System, see web/README.txt.

For more information on installing the caAERS eLearning System, see web/INSTALLATION.
