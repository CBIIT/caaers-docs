</tr><tr><td>625</td><td>caAERS Application Development -  Part II (Elaboration Phase)</td><td>Social/political/cultural</td><td>Development team is made up of three geographically disperse contractors (SemanticBits, Akaza Research, and Northwestern U) which may make communications difficult which could lead to schedule delays or quality shortcomings.</td><td>1 = approximately 25% (possible but not likely that Risk will occur in next 30 days)</td><td>(M) Moderate</td><td>(R-MIT) Resolved - Mitigated</td><td>We have implemented a regular meeting schedule and opened the lines of communications between the different teams. We are using GForge site as a central work collaboration forum and are using SVN source control to manage key documents and files.  In addition, many of the team members have worked together in the past which should help to reduce any risks from this  area.  Furthermore the project team is using an iterative approach which should limit this risk and any subsequent impact if the risk does occur.</td><td>20</td><td>&nbsp;</font></td><td>12/29/2006 11:33:33 AM</td><td>12/1/2006</td><td>12/11/2006</td><td>&nbsp;</font></td><td>The project team will continue to work on keeping communications open, current, and clear to address this ongoing risk.</td><td>&nbsp;</font></td><td>Internal</td></tr><tr><td>626</td><td>caAERS Application Development -  Part II (Elaboration Phase)</td><td>Technical </td><td>This will be the first project at NCICB using SVN (rather than CVS) as source control tool with Gforge and we may therefore run into some unexpected support issues due to the Application Support team's lack of experience with SVN. If we do run into issues, this could cause schedule delays.</td><td>1 = approximately 25% (possible but not likely that Risk will occur in next 30 days)</td><td>(M) Moderate</td><td>(R-MIT) Resolved - Mitigated</td><td>We will work closely with Robert Wysong and the rest of the NCICB Application support team to make sure that SVN is operating properly. Our goal will be to iron out problems in early stage before there is a big risk of impact to the project. SVN is being fully supported (monitored, supported, backed up, etc.) by NCICB Application Support team and the risk of any serious problems or impact to our project is deemed minor.</td><td>10</td><td>&nbsp;</font></td><td>12/29/2006 11:42:14 AM</td><td>12/1/2006</td><td>&nbsp;</font></td><td>&nbsp;</font></td><td>The benefits outweigh the risks here.

For example, we will combine our Elaborators meeting with the AE_SIG meeting. In addition, we will seek to complete as much as possible outside of meetings, using other means, such as email, listservs, and collaborative review of documents. In addition, we will work with Daniela Smith to help us centrally coordinate meeting times and schedules with the different stakeholder groups.</td><td>10</td><td>&nbsp;</font></td><td>12/29/2006 11:48:33 AM</td><td>12/8/2006</td><td>&nbsp;</font></td><td>&nbsp;</font></td><td>The competition for meeting times is an ongoing risk. </td><td>&nbsp;</font></td><td>External</td></tr><tr><td>628</td><td>caAERS Application Development -  Part II (Elaboration Phase)</td><td>Resource </td><td>Holiday season during first iteration will make it hard to schedule key kickoff meetings and the first caAERS face-to-face meeting in December.</td><td>2 = approximately 50% (chances are even that risk will occur in next 30 days)</td><td>(N) Negligible</td><td>(R-MIT) Resolved - Mitigated</td><td>Move Face-To-Face Meeting to first week of January.

The F2F meeting will focus heavily on this topic and will be a forum for making this issue visible to all stakeholders and for getting final agreement. We will involve BAH and NCI teams in assisting to make the vision and scope and project direction clear to all stakeholders. We will explain that by virtue of our iterative approach, we will be able to accomodate most requirements as part of future iterations. We will drive towards an explicit and documented decision on the approach to AEs vs SAEs at the F2F meeting.</td><td>20</td><td>&nbsp;</font></td><td>12/29/2006 12:12:02 PM</td><td>12/19/2006</td><td>&nbsp;</font></td><td>&nbsp;</font></td><td>The decision on whether the caAERS system should focus, as part of this project, on addressing all AEs or just SAEs is not clearly spelled out in the SOW or R1 UCs and supplemental Reqt docs.</td><td>BAH and NCI to be called upon to make determination on whether caAERS system will be built initially to cover just SAEs or to capture all AE's.</td><td>External</td></tr><tr><td>631</td><td>caAERS Application Development -  Part II (Elaboration Phase)</td><td>Resource </td><td>Unexpected illness to key personnel.
