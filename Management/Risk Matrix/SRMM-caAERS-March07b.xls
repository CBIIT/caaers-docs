Meet with Frank Hartel to find out the feasibility of using NCI's MedDRA license.

There will likely be cases where CDEs don't exist and need to be created or exist but need to be harmonized. For some CDEs, this process may involve multiple stakeholders are required a lot of time to resolve.</td><td>1 = approximately 25% (possible but not likely that Risk will occur in next 30 days)</td><td>(N) Negligible</td><td>(PND) Pending</td><td>(1) Meet with VCDE Lead and Mentor and CDE Harmonization representative to discuss issues and approach.
