                1.0 caAERS Introduction and History
================================================================

     
    The caAERS application is still in development. 

    The caAERS application development project began on 
    December 1, 2006. The goal of this project is to develop
    and to deploy an adverse event reporting system that 
    is nationally scalable with a robust architecture to meet 
    the needs of the caBIG™ Community. The Developer Team will 
    execute Elaboration, Construction and Transition Phase 
    activities for this project. The project will be carried 
    out using the Agile Unified Process Framework, emphasizing 
    continuous integration, testing, and risk management. A new
    release will be issued at the end of each iteration. The
    current project is scheduled to end in December 2007.

    caAERS is a product of the NCI Center for Bioinformatics
    and its partners. Visit the caAERS project web site for more

================================================================
                3.0 New Features and Updates
================================================================

   The following new features have been implemented in this 
   release:

   
   -- The following new sections have been added to the Create
      Expedited Report flow:
	 
	- Radiation Intervention
        - Surgery Intervention
        - Medical Device
        - Additional Information

      The Create Expedited Report flow in caAERS now captures most of the
      data captured by AdEERS for the 10-day Expedited Report.

      Some of the items we're currently not capturing include:

       - TAC Code (A method for importing TAC codes from CTEP into
         caAERS is being investigated.)
       - Start and End Dates for all AEs on report. (We only capture dates
         for primary AE. This will be fixed in future release.)
       - Crossover Studies.

 
   -- An Assessment page has been added to the Create Expedited Report 
      Flow. The Assessment page appears after the user completes the 
      Basic AE page and the Reporter page. The Assessment page
      displays the results from the Rules Engine and informs the user
      about the types of reports that need to be prepared and submitted
      based on the information entered into caAERS up to that point.


  --  Rules. A number of new features have been added to the Rules section
      of caAERS. With this release, the rules engine has been integrated
      with the AE data capture and reporting functionality and is now ready 
      for preliminary testing.

      Note: The use of the Rules section will be covered during a training 
      session. Covering the use of these sections is beyond the scope of 
      these release notes.

      Rules includes two key features:

      -> Create/Manage Rules. Rules can now be created at one of the following
         levels:
	- Sponsor Level
        - Institution Level
        - Sponsor Defined Study Level
        - Institution Defined Study Level

      -> Create Report Definition. This section allows users to create report
         definitions that can then be associated with particular organizations
         or studies. As part of the process of creating a Report Definition, 
         a user will specify the following:

       - Required Data.  The set of Required and Optional Data fields to be
         captured as part of the report. (Not implemented in this release.)

       - Report Delivery Configuration. To whom or to what service the report
         should be submitted and the format of the submitted report.

       - Notification Details. The text, recipients, and timing of notifications
         to be sent out whenever a report is initiated.

  --  Import Studies and Participants. The import studies and participants
      feature has been updated to include recent changes to the caAERS
      model. This feature allows users to import existing studies into caAERS.

  --  Advanced Search. A new tab has been added (Advanced Search) to allow users
      to search for Studies, Participants, Adverse Events, Routine AE's, and 
      Expedited Reports.

  --  Export AE data. A new feature has been added that allows users to export
      data from caAERS as comma separated text (csv files). Data for export is 
      selected by using the Advanced Search feature.

  --  Online Help. The online help feature has been partially implemented as 
      part of this release.  

  
   Existing Features:

   For a list of features currently implemented in caAERS, refer
   to earlier versions of the Release Notes (1.0, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4).



================================================================
                4.0 Bugs Fixed Since Last Release
================================================================
  The following bugs related to functionality have been fixed 
  since the last release.
  
   -- Remove Grade 0 as a grading option for Expedited Reports.
   -- Show CTC version as read only on Basics/AEs tab.
   -- Disease has been added as a potential cause
      to the Attributions section of Expedited Report.

  Note: For this release, the developers focused primarily on new 
  features rather than bug fixing. High-level, Sev 1 type bugs
  have been addressed. Low to Mid level bugs, however, will be fixed 
  as part of Iterations 6 and 7.


================================================================
                5.0 Known Issues
================================================================
   

   1. The current version does not check for duplicates:
   -- No system check for duplicate Subjects.
   -- No system check for duplicate Studies.
   -- No system check for duplicate AEs.

   2. In the current version, the system does not check for
   valid past or future dates yet. This will be implemented in a 
   future release.

   3. The current release does not specifically support Prevention 
   Trials. The ability for users to create expedited AE reports for
   DCP-Sponsored trials is currently being added.

   4. The Prior Therapies tab currently does not prompt users
   to list agents when users select an entry (e.g., chemotherapy)
   for which a list of agents is required.

   5. Radiation, Surgery, and Device currently appear by default
   whenever a user is creating an expedited report. These sections
   should appear only for certain studies. (This will be implemented
   in future release.)

   6. The Expedited Report flow does not clearly display on all
   pages which fields are required and which fields are optional. 
   (This will be implemented in future release.)

   7. The Routine AE section allows users to create multiple
   routine AEs. But after saving these, only one of the AEs is
   actually saved and available for viewing. This will be fixed
   in a later release.
