                1.0 caAERS Introduction and History
================================================================

     
    The caAERS application is still in development. 

    The caAERS application development project began on 
    December 1, 2006. The goal of this project is to develop
    and to deploy an adverse event reporting system that 
    is nationally scalable with a robust architecture to meet 
    the needs of the caBIG™ Community. The Developer Team will 
    execute Elaboration, Construction and Transition Phase 
    activities for this project. The project will be carried 
    out using the Agile Unified Process Framework, emphasizing 
    continuous integration, testing, and risk management. A new
    release will be issued at the end of each iteration. The
    current project is scheduled to end in September 2007.

    caAERS is a product of the NCI Center for Bioinformatics
    and its partners. Visit the caAERS project web site for more

                4.0 Bugs Fixed Since Last Release
================================================================
  
   -- 4233: Space search in term creates pretty spectacular error 
            message.
   -- 4280: The system never checks user input for required fields 
            to create a new study.
   -- 4291: Filter and Clear buttons do Not work on the summary 
            page of AE
   -- 4292: Notify link for AE does not work with warning message
   -- 4325: Need dropdown or list boxes for selecting patients
   -- 4327: Expected Y/N field should default to N
   -- 4215: Multicenter checkbox cannot be a required field.
   -- 4280: The system never checks user input for required fields 
            to create a new study.
   -- 5326: The CTC V2 box is too long and doesn't dispaly an arrow
            for the drop down menu
   -- 5333: Items 5 and 6 of 5333 have been fixed. 5- Nadir value - 
            Nadir only makes sense for the low wbc, platelet etc. 
            but not for all labs since some lab AEs are higher values
            than normal. Nadir means the low point. The label for 
            this variable should read "AE lab value". 6. Nadir value 
            date should be labeled "AE lab value date" or "Date of 
            lab value" and should not allow future dates.


================================================================
                5.0 Known Issues
================================================================
   
   1. The current version of caAERS has not been optimized for use
   on Internet Explorer 7. When using IE 7, some fields may be 
   misaligned on the page.

   2. The current version does not check for duplicates:
   -- No system check for duplicate Subjects.
   -- No system check for duplicate Studies.
   -- No system check for duplicate AEs.

   3. In the current version, the system does not check for
   valid past or future dates yet. This will be implemented in a 
   future release.
