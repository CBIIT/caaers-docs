                1.0 caAERS Introduction and History
================================================================

     
    The caAERS application is still in development. 

    The caAERS application development project began on 
    December 1, 2006. The goal of this project is to develop
    and to deploy an adverse event reporting system that 
    is nationally scalable with a robust architecture to meet 
    the needs of the caBIG™ Community. The Developer Team will 
    execute Elaboration, Construction and Transition Phase 
    activities for this project. The project will be carried 
    out using the Agile Unified Process Framework, emphasizing 
    continuous integration, testing, and risk management. A new
    release will be issued at the end of each iteration. The
    current project is scheduled to end in September 2007.

    caAERS is a product of the NCI Center for Bioinformatics
    and its partners. Visit the caAERS project web site for more

================================================================
                3.0 New Features and Updates
================================================================

   The following new features have been implemented in this 
   release:

   
   -- Create SAE Report flow: New Features

      -> The AE Event Description Page has been added. This page
         corresponds closely to the AE Event Description section in
         AdEERS. 

      -> A Summary Panel has been added to each page. This Panel shows
         a list of key information pertinent to the report being
         completed. This is an early iteration of the Summary Panel.
         Some of the fields are not showing the correct information
         at the present time. We will be adding additional fields to this
         Panel in future releases. Feedback on data that should go in
         the Summary Panel is welcomed.
         
   -- Create SAE Report flow: Updates

      -> Attribution to Study has been added to the Basics Tab. This
         field captures the AE's attribution at a high level and is
         used as one of the key parameters by the rules engine to
         determine if an AE requires routine or expedited reporting. In
         the case of expedited reporting, the reporter will still be 
         able on the Attributions Tab to specify attributions at a more
         fine grained level.

      -> On the Basics page, the text associated with Grades is now context 
         sensitive.  That is, the Grades and associated text that appears
         is now determined by what CTC Category and Term is selected.
      -> The "Save and Continue" button has been removed and replaced with 3
         buttons:  Reset Tab, Save, and Save and Continue. This was done
         so that a user could choose to save the information on a page without
         having to move to a different page. That is, a user can now do partial 
         saves.

   -- Routine AEs: New Features
      -> The Enter Routine AE feature has been added. This is designed to be
         a more efficient interface for entering multiple AE's initially diagnosed
         by the user as routine AE's. This feature is accessed from the Adverse 
         Events tab. After selecting a Study and Participant, the user is then
         shown a full list of CTC categories. The applicable categories can be selected. 
         Using this narrowed-down list of categories, the user can then quickly enter
         the key details for the relevant AEs. (Note: After the AE's are created and
         saved, the rules engine will be invoked and will assess/confirm whether the 
         AE's are routine or whether expedited reporting is required. This feature is
         not fully working in the current release.)

   -- Study and Participant Abstraction: Updates

      -> The Create Study flow has been refactored. A number of issues and bugs
         were corrected.
      -> We have fixed the issue that users were running into when creating a Study.
         We've added validation at the Study Investigator and Study Personnel 
         pages to ensure that users cannot enter a name while creating a study 
         that is not on the existing list of Investigators and Research Staff. 
         Currently, users can only add new Investigators or Staff in the Administration
         section. In the previous release, if a user entered a new name during the
         Create Study flow, the name was accepted, but the application produced an 
         error at the end of the create study flow, and none of the Study data was 
         saved. This problem should not occur in the current release.
      -> The Search by Short Title functionality has been fixed.
      -> The CTCAE version selection has been moved to the Study section. Users will
         specify the CTCAE version for the Study during study creation. It was
         previously located in the AE Report section. (Note: The CTCAE selection
         field still appears in the AE Report flow. We will fix this in future release so
         that it appears in the AE report as a non-editable field.)

   -- Rules
      -> Study Level Rules.  Users can now create Study level rules.
      -> Report Calendar and Notification Templates. Users can now create report calendars
         and associated notifications. 
      
      (Note: The use of the Rules and Notifications sections will be covered during
      a training session. Covering the use of these sections is beyond the scope of these
      release notes.)

                5.0 Known Issues
================================================================
   

   1. The current version does not check for duplicates:
   -- No system check for duplicate Subjects.
   -- No system check for duplicate Studies.
   -- No system check for duplicate AEs.

   3. In the current version, the system does not check for
   valid past or future dates yet. This will be implemented in a 
   future release.

   4. The current release does not specifically support Prevention 
   Trials. The ability for users to create expedited AE reports for
   DCP-Sponsored trials is currently being added.
