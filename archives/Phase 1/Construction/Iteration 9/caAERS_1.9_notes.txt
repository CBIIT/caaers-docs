                1.0 caAERS Introduction and History
================================================================

     
    History:
 
    The Cancer Adverse Event Reporting System (caAERS) 
    application has completed development and is
    currently in the transition phase. The target public launch
    date for caAERS 1.0, as a stand-alone application, is 
    March 3, 2008.

    The caAERS application development project began on 
    December 1, 2006. The goal of this project is to develop
    and to deploy an adverse event reporting system that 
    is nationally scalable with a robust architecture to meet 
    the needs of the caBIG™ Community. The Developer Team will 
    execute Elaboration, Construction and Transition Phase 
    activities for this project. The project will be carried 
    out using the Agile Unified Process Framework, emphasizing 
    continuous integration, testing, and risk management. A new
    release will be issued at the end of each iteration. The
    current project is scheduled to end in the first quarter of
    2008.

    caAERS is a product of the NCI Center for Bioinformatics
    and its partners. Visit the caAERS project web site for more
    information:

    Description of caAERS:

    The Cancer Adverse Event Reporting System (caAERS) is an 
    open source, web-based application for documenting, managing, 
    reporting, and analyzing adverse events (AEs).  The system 
    operates as both a repository for capturing and tracking 
    routine and serious AEs and as a tool for preparing and 
    submitting expedited AE reports to regulatory agencies.  
    Currently, caAERS works with cancer prevention and therapeutic 
    trials and can accommodate  a range of intervention types, 
    including investigational and commercial agents, radiation, 
    surgery, and medical devices. Adverse events can be coded in 
    caAERS using either CTCAE or MedDRA.


    To help organizations stay in compliance with AE reporting 
    regulations, the caAERS application comes loaded with a full 
    complement of industry-standard AE reports, including the FDA 
    MedWatch 3500A form, the CTEP AdEERS reports, and the NCI-DCP 
    SAE form. In addition, the caAERS system features a powerful, 
    state-of-the-art rules engine, which can capture a range of 
    sponsor, institution, and protocol-level reporting requirements.  
    Using these rules, caAERS can automatically determine if an 
    adverse event requires expedited reporting and when and to whom 
    the report must be submitted -- for any of an organization's 
    trials. The business rules used by caAERS can be authored within 
    the application itself or imported from a library of approved 
    rule sets.


    caAERS also features an advanced email-based alert system that 
    can be customized along a number of dimensions (message content, 
    recipients, delivery times) to ensure that notifications and 
    reminders are sent out as needed. Also included as part of 
    caAERS is an easy-to-use report template generator, which 
    allows users to build and customize reports.


    caAERS can be deployed as a stand-alone application or as an 
    integrated module within the caBIG Clinical Trials Suite (CCTS).

================================================================
                3.0 New Features and Updates
================================================================

   The following new features have been implemented in this 
   release:

   
   1. caAERS to AdEERS Integration. Completed 5-day or 10-day 
      reports for CTEP sponsored trials can be submitted 
      electronically to CTEP's AdEERS system. Upon successful
      submission, an AdEERS Ticket Number will be generated and
      sent to the reporter, along with a link to the report in
      the AdEERS system. If the report is not accepted for
      for submission, an email describing the problems will be
      sent to the reporter. The caAERS system validates reports against
      a set of 80 business rules to determine if the report meets
      the criteria for submission to AdEERS.

   2. Additional Reporting Pathways Added. DCP Non-CCOPS trials
      are now supported. With DCP Non-CCOPS trials, AE's are 
      reported to the NCI Medical Monitor and to a regulatory 
      reviewer using the DCP Serious Adverse Event Form. In 
      certain cases, an IND Safety Report is also sent to the FDA.
     
      To handle these additional reporting pathways, we have made 
      three key changes: 
      
      a). In Study setup, we have added a new field on the Details 
      page. The new field is "AdEERS Reporting Required?". It has 
      two values: Yes and No. If No, caAERS will walk the reporter
      down a different create Expedited AE flow than the current
      AdEERS-compatible Expedited AE flow.
      
      b). We have added a new data field -- Outcome Indicator -- 
      that appears only for Non-AdEERS reporting. This field 
      corresponds to the Why Serious or Outcome Indictor field
      specified in the FDA regulations governing Adverse Events. 
      The field has the following 7 valid values:

        - Death
        - Life Threatening
        - Hospitalization
        - Disability or Permanent Damage
        - Congenital Anomaly/Birth Defect
        - Other Serious
        - Required Intervention to Prevent Permanent 
          Impairment/Damage (Devices)



      c). We have added these two new attributes -- "AdEERS Reporting 
      Required?" and "Outcome Indicator" -- to the Rules UI. This 
      allows for the creation of rules based on these new attributes. 
      For DCP Non-CCOPS, an expedited report is required, for example, 
      if  any of the items in the Outcome Indicator field are checked.


   3. Password Policy Configuration. From the Administration Tab, 
      an Administrator can set the password policy to be enforced 
      by caAERS. The policy can be configured along a number of 
      dimensions, including maximum password age, number of failed
      login attempts, lockout duration, minimum password age, password
      history size, minimum password length, password history size, 
      minimum password length, complexity requirements, largest
      substring of username allowed, 

   4. Forgot Password / Reset Password Feature. The Forgot Password
      feature is now operational. The Forgot Password link is on the
      Login page. An email will be sent to the user's email address, 
      which will include a link to a secured page where the 
      user will be able to create a new password for logging into
      caAERS. The user can use this feature to reset his or her 
      password. When a password is reset, the current password 
      policy will be enforced.



   The following enhancements are included in this release:

   - Imports - Study, Participant, Routine AE. 

     Minor changes to the XML schemas to accommodate ongoing 
     development and subsequent model changes

     Data into caAERS are located here:

     import/0.9/?root=caaersappdev



   Expedited AE:
 
   - 80+ Validations added to the Create Expedited Report flow. 
     The user will be alerted on screen if a business rule has 
     been violated, and will be prompted to correct the issue
     before proceeding.
   - New Home Page with full list of Tasks has been made the new
     default page in caAERS. When a user logs in, they will land
     on this new home page.
   - Additional minor UI changes
 
 

   Study:
   - Added field to capture whether trial submits reports to
     AdEERS.
