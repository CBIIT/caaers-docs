                1.0 caAERS Introduction and History
================================================================

     
    The caAERS application is still in development. 

    The caAERS application development project began on 
    December 1, 2006. The goal of this project is to develop
    and to deploy an adverse event reporting system that 
    is nationally scalable with a robust architecture to meet 
    the needs of the caBIG™ Community. The Developer Team will 
    execute Elaboration, Construction and Transition Phase 
    activities for this project. The project will be carried 
    out using the Agile Unified Process Framework, emphasizing 
    continuous integration, testing, and risk management. A new
    release will be issued at the end of each iteration. The
    current project is scheduled to end in September 2007.

    caAERS is a product of the NCI Center for Bioinformatics
    and its partners. Visit the caAERS project web site for more

================================================================
                3.0 New Features and Updates
================================================================

   The following new features have been implemented in this 
   release:

   
   -- Create SAE Report flow: New Features

      -> The Medical Information Tab has been completed. This page
         corresponds roughly to the Patient Information section in 
         AdEERS. The following patient information is captured 
         on this page: Height, Weight, Baseline Performance Status 
         (using Zobrod Scale) and Patient Disease Information (Disease,
         Names, Disease Sites, Date of Initial Diagnosis). In addition, 
         users can add Metastatic Disease Sites from this page.
          
      -> The Treatment Information Tab has been completed. This page
         corresponds roughly to the Course section in AdEERS. The 
         following information is captured in Treatment: First Course Date,
         AE Course Start Date, Course Number on which AE occurred, Course
         Agent. Multiple Course Agents can be added.  

      -> The Prior Therapies Tab has been added. Users can add multiple
         therapies or can skip this tab if no prior therapies apply.
         Users can select a Prior Therapy using the auto complete search
         functionality or can choose Other and key in a term.

      -> The Other Contribution Causes Tab has been completed. Uses can
         add multiple causes or skip this section if it does not apply.
         Users enter causes in a text box.

      -> The Reporter Tab has been completed. Users can enter Reporter 
         details and Physician details on this page. In future iterations,
         The Reporter details will be set by default to the show the data
         for the user currently logged into the system. Users will be able
         to edit this information if needed. As implemented now, users can
         select the Reporter from a drop down list or can manually key in
         the data.
         
  
   -- Create SAE Report flow: Updates

      -> Attribution Tab. Course and Other Causes have been added to the
         AE Attribution page. Users can now attribute an AE to the following:
         Course (Agent), Concomitant Medications, and Other Contributing 
         Causes. The ability to attribute an AE to Disease and to Devices 
         will be added to this page in a future iteration.


   -- Study and Participant Abstraction: New Features

      -> Importing Studies from Local CTMS.  We have added a new import feature.
         Users can now import Study Abstraction data into caAERS. Multiple studies
         can be imported. The import requires that the Study data be saved as an 
         XML file. Information about the schema can be obtained from ... The
         import can be initiated from within caAERS from the Administration Tab 
         or from the command line. Note: This feature is designed to work in 
         concert with the Participant Import feature described below.

      -> Importing Participants from Local CTMS. Users can import Participants
         from an XML file. The import can be initiated from within caAERS from 
         the Administration Tab or from the command line.

      -> Support for MedDRA 9.0.  We have added support for MedDRA 9.0 in this
         release. When assigning Diseases to a Study, users can now enter a
         MedDRA term (v.9) to identify diseases. When a term is entered, caAERS 
         will verify that the entered term is a valid MedDRA code and will then 
         display the code and term. caAERS does not include its own MedDRA browser.
         Users will need to use the MedDRA Browser from MSSO or some other external
         tool to determine or find the MedDRA term/code appropriate to the study.  
         Previously, users were limited to selecting diseases from the CTEP 
         Disease List. Note: The MedDRA codeset must first be imported into 
         caAERS from the Administration Tab. This is a one-time set up and 
         configuration step.

================================================================
                4.0 Bugs Fixed Since Last Release
================================================================
  
   -- 4233: Space search in term creates pretty spectacular error 
            message.
   -- 4280: The system never checks user input for required fields 
            to create a new study.
   -- 4291: Filter and Clear buttons do Not work on the summary 
            page of AE
   -- 4292: Notify link for AE does not work with warning message
   -- 4325: Need dropdown or list boxes for selecting patients
   -- 4327: Expected Y/N field should default to N
   -- 4215: Multicenter checkbox cannot be a required field.
   -- 4280: The system never checks user input for required fields 
            to create a new study.
   -- 5326: The CTC V2 box is too long and doesn't display an arrow
            for the drop down menu
   -- 5333: Items 5 and 6 of 5333 have been fixed. 5- Nadir value - 
            Nadir only makes sense for the low wbc, platelet etc. 
            but not for all labs since some lab AEs are higher values
            than normal. Nadir means the low point. The label for 
            this variable should read "AE lab value". 6. Nadir value 
            date should be labeled "AE lab value date" or "Date of 
            lab value" and should not allow future dates.


================================================================
                5.0 Known Issues
================================================================
   
   1. The current version of caAERS has not been optimized for use
   on Internet Explorer 7. When using IE 7, some fields may be 
   misaligned on the page.

   2. The current version does not check for duplicates:
   -- No system check for duplicate Subjects.
   -- No system check for duplicate Studies.
   -- No system check for duplicate AEs.

   3. In the current version, the system does not check for
   valid past or future dates yet. This will be implemented in a 
   future release.

   4. The current release does not support Prevention Trials. Support
   for Prevention Trials will be added in future iterations. The
   focus of this release is on CTEP-sponsored trials.
