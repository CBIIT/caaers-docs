                1.0 caAERS Introduction and History
================================================================

     
    The caAERS application is still in development. 

    The caAERS application development project began on 
    December 1, 2006. The goal of this project is to develop
    and to deploy an adverse event reporting system that 
    is nationally scalable with a robust architecture to meet 
    the needs of the caBIG™ Community. The Developer Team will 
    execute Elaboration, Construction and Transition Phase 
    activities for this project. The project will be carried 
    out using the Agile Unified Process Framework, emphasizing 
    continuous integration, testing, and risk management. A new
    release will be issued at the end of each iteration. The
    current project is scheduled to end in January 2008.

    caAERS is a product of the NCI Center for Bioinformatics
    and its partners. Visit the caAERS project web site for more
