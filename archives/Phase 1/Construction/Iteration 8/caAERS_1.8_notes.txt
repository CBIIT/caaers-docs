                1.0 caAERS Introduction and History
================================================================

     
    The caAERS application is still in development. 

    The caAERS application development project began on 
    December 1, 2006. The goal of this project is to develop
    and to deploy an adverse event reporting system that 
    is nationally scalable with a robust architecture to meet 
    the needs of the caBIG™ Community. The Developer Team will 
    execute Elaboration, Construction and Transition Phase 
    activities for this project. The project will be carried 
    out using the Agile Unified Process Framework, emphasizing 
    continuous integration, testing, and risk management. A new
    release will be issued at the end of each iteration. The
    current project is scheduled to end in January 2008.

    caAERS is a product of the NCI Center for Bioinformatics
    and its partners. Visit the caAERS project web site for more
    information:

================================================================
                3.0 New Features and Updates
================================================================

   The following new features have been implemented in this 
   release:

   
   1.  Import Routine AE Data. Users can import XML files with
   routine AE data. caAERS accepts current routine AE data or 
   legacy AE data. Current routine AE data will be checked against
   the existing rules to assess whether any of the imported AEs
   require expedited reporting.


   Link to latest version of XSD and sample XML files for Importing
   AE Data into caAERS:
   https://gforge.nci.nih.gov/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs.php/docs/
   import/0.8/?root=caaersappdev


   2.  The caGrid Data Service has been secured with the addition
   of an authentication service. See the caAERS Install Guide for
   additional information.


   3.  A number of features for use within the CaBIG Clinical
   Trials Suite have been added to this release, including
   support for 

   -- Sending Alerts to the Patient Study Calendar
   application regarding possible schedule changes for AEs.
   -- Study Creation (initiated in the C3PR application).
   -- Patient Registration (initiated in the C3PR application).
   



   The following enhancements are included in this release:

   Expedited AE:
 
   - Moved Course/Agent section forward in flow. This section now 
     appears right after the Enter AE section.
   - Rules can be triggered based on treatment arm information now
   - Removed Summary Panel for cleaner UI in Expedited Report flow.
   - Added MedDRA auto-completer field as option when CTC term with

   - Ability to export report as XML file.

     the routine AE page.


   Study:

   - Added MedDRA auto-completer field for selecting Disease for 
     study abstraction.
