This directory is for tracking caAERS dependencies which are not available 
from a public maven2 repo.

To add a jar
------------
- Add the jar to the jar directory
- Add a line containing the metadata to 3rd-party-maven-jars.tsv
  Note that this file is a tab-separated plain text file.  There is a header
  row describing the columns.

To add a pom only
-----------------
- Add it to the pom directory  
  (The metadata will be extracted from the pom.)

Testing
-------
Please test out your changes before committing them. Use the provided ruby
script:

 $ ./sync-3rd-party.rb

Without options, the script will install the deps into your local repository.
Use the -h option for full usage directions.

Deployment
----------
Additions and changes to this directory are automatically picked up by the 
build server and deployed into the repository at 
http://download.bioinformatics.northwestern.edu/maven2.  You can see the 
output of the sync script at 

https://buddy.bioinformatics.northwestern.edu/hudson/job/caAERS%20dependency%20deployer/lastBuild/console

Things removed from this directory will not be automatically removed from the
repository. If you need something removed, send an e-mail to 
r-sutphin@northwestern.edu.

Caveats
-------
Currently maven only supports the "classifier" option for deploy, not install.
(See http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MINSTALL-24 .)  For this reason, any 
classified jars (sources, javadoc) should come _before_ the main jar in the
TSV.  This will at least make sure that your local repo gets the main jar
if you execute install.
